Removes quartz and diamonds as loot 

Only lets you exit to the overworld instead of being placed in random dimensions like the Nether or Alfheim

Stopped doors from creating rifts and closing when entities and players enter the dungeon, this means you can enter dungeons with your friends 

Fixed black fog and dark sky when a mob randomly enters a dimensional door and change limbo fog colour to better match the vibe
